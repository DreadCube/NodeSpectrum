1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,400
I know you'll look the other way

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,800
I know you long for something new

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,300
So there you're wasting all your day

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Looking for something that was right in front of you

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:40,500
And I just want them to notice you

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:56,000
And I, I'll never let go of you

7
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,900
There's something flying in the air

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,300
And I just don't know what it could be

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Smoke is flying everywhere

10
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,900
I'm getting the feeling it's the end for you and me

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,300
And I, I know that we might be through

12
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:55,300
But I, I'll never let go of you

13
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,400
I'll never let go of you

14
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,100
I know you'll look the other way

15
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,500
I know you long for something new

16
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,000
So there you're wasting all your day

17
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,600
Looking for something that was right in front of you

18
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:55,200
And I just want them to notice you

19
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:09,900
And I, I'll never let go of you

20
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,000
There's something flying in the air

21
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,300
And I just don't know what it could be

22
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,800
Smoke is flying everywhere

23

I'm getting the feeling it's the end for you and me

24
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:39,400
And I, I know that we might be through

25
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:54,700
But I, I'll never let go of you

26
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,400
I'll never let go of you
